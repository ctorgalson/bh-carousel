# BH Carousel

This project provides a markup-independent javascript implementation of the WAI
ARIA [Carousel pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/)
for use in npm or browser projects.

The script is fully independent of any design-system, but that means you have
to BYOCSS.

See `demo/` for a sample implementation.

The project will provide npm packages once it reaches a more stable condition.
